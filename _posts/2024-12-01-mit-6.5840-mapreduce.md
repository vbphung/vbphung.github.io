title: I've just completed MIT 6.5840 MapReduce Lab

I don't really got much to say in fact, just wanna test Jekyll. But there's truly something I find interesting to share.

# `os.Rename` will not work

You'd see a hint provided by MIT that

> To ensure that nobody observes partially written files in the presence of crashes, the MapReduce paper mentions the trick of using a temporary file and atomically renaming it once it is completely written. You can use `ioutil.TempFile` (or `os.CreateTemp` if you are running Go 1.17 or later) to create a temporary file and `os.Rename` to atomically rename it.

However, temp files in Linux (I'm not sure about OSX), which you can find at `/tmp/`, are not on the same filesystem as your desired output files, meanwhile `os.Rename` doesn't work across filesystems. Therefore, if you stick with this hint, you may encounter an error like this

```
rename /tmp/2829667613 mr-2-0: invalid cross-device link
```

A straightforward solution - just copy the content of the temp file to the desired output file and then (optional) remove the temp file... like this

```go
func moveFile(src, dest string) error {
    s, err := os.Open(src)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("open source file %s: %v", src, err)
    }
    defer s.Close()

    d, err := os.Create(dest)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("create dest file %s: %v", dest, err)
    }
    defer d.Close()

    _, err = io.Copy(d, s)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("copy content: %v", err)
    }

    err = os.Remove(src)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("remove source file %s: %v", src, err)
    }

    return nil
}
```

Nevertheless, you're still able to pass this Lab if going with `os.Symlink` with certain caution in the crash test.

```go
func persistTempFile(f *os.File, path string) error {
    if err := f.Close(); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("close file %s: %v", f.Name(), err)
    }

    // Symlink will crash if the target file already exists
    if err := os.Symlink(f.Name(), path); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("move file %s to %s: %v", f.Name(), path, err)
    }

    return nil
}
```

# This is not section 2

Nothing else to add. So... here's something about my implementation.

- Map routines produce a list of key-value pairs and my job is making sure all same keys are grouped in the same Reduce task. To achieve this, I associate a key with a Reduce task ID, which is used to name Map output files.
- All Map tasks must be completed before any Reduce task can be assigned to workers.
- Workers will not notify Coordinator when they fail, so Coordinator has to run a cron job to restore the timeout task's status to `Idle`.
